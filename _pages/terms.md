# Research

Welcome to my research portfolio. Here I highlight my academic and internship projects, the skills I gained, and my publications.

---

## Research Experience

### Emotion Recognition Internship (Summer 2025)

**Mentor:** Dr. Yunting Yin  
**Focus:** Emotion recognition using machine learning on image- and text-based datasets  

During my internship, I processed large datasets and trained a **convolutional neural network (CNN)** in Python. I handled:

- Data preparation and cleaning
- Model evaluation and optimization
- Adapting ML workflows for practical use  

This project strengthened my experience in **machine learning pipelines**, **Python programming**, and **handling real-world datasets**.

## Skills Gained

- `Python` – data processing and model building  
- `PyTorch` – deep learning framework for neural networks  
- `NumPy` – numerical computing and data manipulation

## Publications

**Malou Gum Cithiec\***, **Tanaka Chirara\***, Carlton Kigonya-Nsubuga\*, Andres Iniguez, and Yunting Yin  
*"InfantFER: Evaluating and Adapting Adult Emotion Models to Infant Faces"*  
Submitted to the European Symposium on Artificial Neural Networks, Computational Intelligence and Machine Learning (ESANN) 2026  

\*Equal contribution

## Optional Additions

If you want, you can create **cards for each project** or add **links to GitHub repositories**. For example:

```liquid
{% include card.html
   title="InfantFER: Emotion Recognition"
   image="assets/images/infantfer.png"
   description="Evaluated and adapted adult emotion models to infant faces using CNNs in Python."
   url="/research/infantfer/"
%}
