## Research Experience
During my Summer 2025 internship, I worked with Dr. Yunting Yin on emotion recognition research using machine learning. I processed image- and text-based datasets and trained a convolutional neural network (CNN) in Python, handling data preparation, model evaluation, and optimization. This work strengthened my experience with large datasets and practical ML workflows.
